                            <br>
                            There is a lot of information about ‘intelligent machines’, but this is only the beginning of the real potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI). According to some experts, its advancement yet lags the hype.
                        </p>

                         
                        <p><b>How come?</b> 
                            <br>
                          People have come a long way that took us millions of years to develop a knack for telling the scrunch of gravel from the whirring sound of fallen leaves under a predator’s light step. And to cram those millions of years of human evolution into a few years for our eager-to-help machines, we have to feed them enormous amounts of audio data.
                          <br>
                          When audio-based machine learning systems quench their thirst for audio knowledge, they will be as good as we are – or even better – at recognizing audio input. Potentially, it will be the beginning of a new era for the smartest virtual assistants we’ve ever dealt with.
