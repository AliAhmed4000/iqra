A multilingual PPC campaign (in French, Russian, German, Italian, English, or Spanish) is an effective way to reach audiences in different countries and make your brand known internationally. It is also an excellent tool for companies that have offices and target markets around the world.</p>

                                      SEO remains a determining lever for acquiring traffic. With 93% of online

                                      beyond the first page of the SERP, companies in pursuit of digital visibility have
                                      more interest than ever in playing the SEO game.
                                      <br><br>
                                      SEO is a very complex game, with its rules changing all the time, forcing SEO
                                      players to adapt continuously. The latest example: the change in the appearance of
                                      sponsored links in Google's SERPs, now only indicated by the presence of the word
                                      ‘ad’ to the left of the URL - the result of a long process of ‘fading’ paid links.
                                      Certainly, this is proof that organic results remain the most favored (most users
                                      continue to ignore ads). But, on the other hand, these regular evolutions make up a
                                      real challenge for webmasters and SEO experts. It’s like playing a game of Monopoly
                                      as the rules change every five minutes!
                                      <br><br>
                                      Hence the importance of staying informed of developments in SEO, and of being
                                      interested in the major emerging trends.
                                      <br><br>
                                      You might as well say it straight away: there is no major upheaval to be expected
                                      this year. The major SEO trends in 2021 take up the key concepts we already know -
                                      the development of artificial intelligence, continuous development of Google's
                                      Mobile-First Indexing, adaptation to voice search, emphasis on user experience... In
                                      short, it is the logical continuation of the 2020 trends.
                                      <br><br>
                                       SEO means making sure that your website will appear at the top of the results given
                                      by search engines after a search carried out by relevant keywords.


                                      <br><br>
                                      Ideally, your business should rank in the first third of the first-page search
                                      results. The further away it is from it, the fewer visits to your website will have.
                                      <br><br>
                                      Since few users go to the second page of results, showing up early in search results
                                      is essential to reaching your customers on the Internet. Visibility on search
                                      engines should therefore be one of the priorities of your web strategy.

                                        There are two distinct SEO types - Search Engine Advertising (SEA) and organic
                                    Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The former is of a pay-to-play kind when you
                                    invest in ads that show up on relevant search engine results pages, the latter is
                                    natural, organic and - most importantly - free. These two SEO types are used with
                                    different goals in mind, with different rules applied.
                                      <br><br>
                                       Obviously, you need an SEO strategy to choose the right one for you. There’s no
                                    crime in using only one or both techniques at the same time. But keep in mind - if
                                    you are in for a long time, the paid ad strategy will not work without ongoing
                                    investment. And since SEO is responsible for your website’s long-term success, some
                                    organic SEO needs to be done.
                                      <br><br>
                                      You should remember that organic SEO campaigns take time to show results. Experts
                                    say it could be up to 4 months before you see tangible improvements in traffic.
                                    Meanwhile, it makes sense to use SEA and make your website visible for those in
                                    search of quality service or product.

                                       There are 4 main kinds of SEO specialists and the price for the work directly
                                    depends on which one you are ready to do business with. They are ‘famous’
                                    consultants, agencies, freelancers, and scammers.

                                       ‘Famous’ consultant
                                      <br><br>
                                       Some SEO consultants ‘made their name’ on the market, often because of their strong
                                    competence, their visibility and their contribution to the global knowledge on SEO.
                                    Their services are therefore priced higher than those of an average consultant. Add
                                    20- 50% to the average rates. And keep in mind that quality, in general, is more
                                    expensive…

                                      <br><br>
                                      Agencies are almost always more expensive than freelancers. They will therefore
                                    generally be higher. The advantage of using an agency lies in its ability to
                                    mobilize various skills and get a team to do it: technical, content, e-commerce,
                                    digital marketing, SEO services ... the slew of skills can be an asset.

                                     SEO freelancers are legion and are generally more competitive than agencies in terms
                                    of pricing. The capacity of a freelancer to deliver must be evaluated because their
                                    schedule can be very busy. Some freelancers work with several people and share the
                                    load. This can be an interesting approach to limit costs. But the risks are higher
                                    too.

                                    Scammers are actually quite easy to spot. They all offer: automatic referencing,
                                    referencing based on the registration of a site in directories, SEO based only on
                                    link building, or any other ‘miracle method’, more or less patented, which does not
                                    clearly explain the means used and the details of how this technology works. They
                                    can promise you an online marketing project of your dreams, translation in any
                                    language for any region possible, great accuracy, and stellar SEO services, but the
                                    simple truth is you will get no good from them no matter how much you pay.

                                     A good benchmark to help you situate yourself is to think about costs vs losses.
                                    Cheaper prices offered by scammers and some freelancers are tied to higher risks.
                                    Services of agencies and experts are higher, but the risks are lower. Moreover,
                                    experienced agencies often offer a follow-up in several fields such as digital
                                    marketing, international SEO, internet marketing, content marketing, keyword
                                    analysis, etc.

                                      Remember that SEO is above all about time spent on your site, content creation, text
                                    modification, improving the experience of your visitors, gaining relevance,
                                    interacting with your prospects. You can always ask the service provider about the
                                    exact content of what will be proposed to you.

                                       The prime advantage of an SEO agency is its experience. Your own SEO skills may be
                                    impeccable but agencies do dozens or even hundreds of SEO projects every year and
                                    their experience could not be possibly matched. They know all ins and outs and can
                                    recommend a strategy that’s right up your company’s street. Moreover, they often
                                    follow it up with a reasonable amount of social media marketing and optimization,
                                    which helps a lot nowadays when everyone spends hours on social media platforms.

                                      For all these reasons, there are some important criteria to consider when choosing
                                    the agency to entrust with the SEO of your site:

                                          First of all, SEO is a profession in its own right. Do not leave it in the care

                                      Finally, it should be noted that SEO allows you to be more easily found by your

                                    sense to call on SEO consultants to adopt a general strategy to your needs.

                                        SEO remains a determining lever for acquiring traffic. With 93% of online
                                      experiences that start on a search engine and 75% of Internet users who do not click
                                      beyond the first page of the SERP, companies in pursuit of digital visibility have
                                      more interest than ever in playing the SEO game.

                                      SEO is a very complex game, with its rules changing all the time, forcing SEO
                                      players to adapt continuously. The latest example: the change in the appearance of
                                      sponsored links in Google's SERPs, now only indicated by the presence of the word
                                      ‘ad’ to the left of the URL - the result of a long process of ‘fading’ paid links.
                                      Certainly, this is proof that organic results remain the most favored (most users
                                      continue to ignore ads). But, on the other hand, these regular evolutions make up a
                                      real challenge for webmasters and SEO experts. It’s like playing a game of Monopoly
                                      as the rules change every five minutes!
                                      <br><br>
                                      Hence the importance of staying informed of developments in SEO, and of being
                                      interested in the major emerging trends.
                                      <br><br>
                                      You might as well say it straight away: there is no major upheaval to be expected
                                      this year. The major SEO trends in 2021 take up the key concepts we already know -
                                      the development of artificial intelligence, continuous development of Google's
                                      Mobile-First Indexing, adaptation to voice search, emphasis on user experience... In
                                      short, it is the logical continuation of the 2020 trends.

                                       SEO means making sure that your website will appear at the top of the results given
                                      by search engines after a search carried out by relevant keywords.

                                      Ideally, your business should rank in the first third of the first-page search
                                      results. The further away it is from it, the fewer visits to your website will have.
                                      <br><br>
                                      Since few users go to the second page of results, showing up early in search results
                                      is essential to reaching your customers on the Internet. Visibility on search
                                      engines should therefore be one of the priorities of your web strategy.
