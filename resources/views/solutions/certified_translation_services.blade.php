                         We don’t just translate words; we translate ideas. PoliLingua isn’t your typical translation company. Many translators in the market translate things word for word or close to it, but in many cases, the true meaning of the content is lost in translation. At PoliLingua, we don’t provide simple translation services. Our goal is to make sure the context and meaning of your documents, audio, or video is translated into a culturally appropriate and accurate message.
                        </p>

                         <p>We have a dedicated team of professional translators at PoliLingua that are certified to provide translation services in a wide variety of foreign languages (not only in English). Since 2002, our agency has been providing translation services in London, UK, and Chisinau, Moldova, with representations in Berlin, Paris, Milan, and Madrid. Our primary goal is to help our clients be successful in global markets by providing them with the best possible language services.</p>

With approximately 20 years of experience and commitment to quality, we will help you spread your message across borders and cultural barriers.
