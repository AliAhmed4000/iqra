                                <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) helps to ensure that your web page appears in a high position when specific keywords are searched for. When multiple languages are targeted then you can increase your ranking in each targeted language being more visible to people searching in those languages.
                                    <br>
                                    This is a low cost way to bring more customers to your website and to appeal to groups of customers that other competing websites are not putting any marketing effort into. Multilingual SEO efforts are particularly useful in markets like South Africa where there are several widely spoken languages. Our experience in successfully using SEO to drive increased site visits in each language based market segment can quickly drive increased sales and place your brand in front of more people.
                                    <br>
                                    There has been a move to using multilingual marketing techniques to try and gain an advantage over traditional marketing techniques that target a single language. It also allows the use of other SEO techniques such as long tail keywords and researching keywords to maximize conversion rates. We can combine these into a campaign for our SEO service in South Africa.

                                <p>Pay per click (PPC) can be a very effective way to advertise to your targeted audience to bring visitors to your website, create marketing leads and drive buyers to your landing pages. We can put together a multilingual PPC campaign that targets your selection of languages. This includes selecting keywords in each language, creating ads in each language and customizing web pages or landing pages to effectively handle visitors that are clicking through from the PPC campaign.
                                    <br>
                                    Our locally based multilingual marketing team does not just copy the same information from one language to another but customizes the keywords, advertising copy and landing pages. This is important because a keyword that is popular in English may not be popular in Zulu, Xhosa or Afrikaans. This also means that the advertising and landing pages need to be specifically targeted both to the keywords and the language being used while still conforming to the overall marketing structure.

                                <p>One of the great uses of PPC campaigns is to build a high quality list of potential customers that you can market to using targeted email marketing. This is a low cost way of building a group of prospects that can be regularly marketed to. We can produce marketing material that can be sent to the people on the list using specific languages that you are targeting.
                                    <br>
                                   This can be done by producing multilingual marketing material in the form of a marketing newsletter in several different language versions. We can produce a single document which has the required languages or several documents that each have a single language version of the marketing material included.
                                    <br>
                                    You might wish to send a single target email to everyone on the list or market by language using the information about the prospects' preferred language to only send the single language version to them. Trying both versions and comparing the conversion rates can help you to focus in on the best way to use targeted email marketing for your customer base.
