                                <p>Search engine optimization, or SEO, is one of the most important tools in business today as it provides companies with the opportunity to reach a wider pool of potential clients through their online operations. By translating key phases and search options into a number of different languages, therefore, businesses can further expand their reach and gain access to an international client base as a means of lifting revenues and increasing profit margins.

                                <p>The science behind SEO can be a little complicated, but in basic terms SEO ensures that, when specific key words or phrases are entered into search engines such as Google, your web page (or even multiple web pages from your overall website) will appear in a high position in the list of returns. Obviously, by translating optimized content into multiple languages, the number of times your website will appear in top searches will increase on a global scale.</p>
                                <p>Polilinguaâ€™s translators are not only able to translate content seamlessly from one language to another, but are also able to insert common search terms from a variety of different languages on a country by country basis. Cultural and linguistic nuances mean that, even in two countries which speak the same language, the phrases and terms most commonly searched for will not be exactly identical, meaning that out translators must recognise which phrases must be utilised in order to help businesses correctly target their desired markets. By combining this with popular SEO techniques such as long tail keywords and researching keywords, this will maximize both webpage hits and conversion rates.</p>
