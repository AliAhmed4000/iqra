                         <p>Hospitality is one of the key industries where translation is absolutely vital. Many businesses within this sector aim to attract visitors from across the globe, so having the ability to communicate with these customers is a matter of huge importance.</p>

                         
                         <p>Guests and travelers from different countries take into account various considerations when evaluating their satisfaction with a service. Recognizing these considerations gives PoliLingua essential insight while performing the translations and localizations.</p>

                        <p>Whatever your segment of the hospitality and travel industry—airline or bus line, tour operator or cruise line, hotel or car rental agency, by reaching your global audience you can grow your brand and profits. PoliLingua will work with you to plan and implement effective global solutions to meet your industry-specific requirements for any language, market, or deadline.</p>
                        <p>Finding solutions for booking and reservations, channel optimization, back-end fulfillment, and revenue management that spans countries, cultures, and languages is critical for our tourism industry clients. But the key is understanding the needs of each market segment and how to meet them through a streamlined globalization initiative.</p>
                        <p>One of the most important tasks a translation service can perform is translating a company website. Whether it is a hotel or restaurant, a theme park or a casino, having a website which can be read in a number of different languages is imperative for the businesses that want to attract custom from all over the world. For potential customers coming from abroad, a website is the first and only chance they get to see the business’ services before they arrive, so having a well-translated site which is in line with company philosophy and coherent with the ethos of the whole brand.</p>
